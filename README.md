Starting point for energydrunk and dramthology.

## How does it work?

In /admin, if you edit an article, it changes the corresponding .md markdown file then pushes those changes to the repo.
If you're working locally, to receive these changes you will need to pull again and restart npm (not sure why, sorry it's annoying)
NB: You can also manually edit the .md files yourself (and restart npm)

## Develop

    npm i
    npm start

## Troubleshooting

### Published something but not showing up on the site? Options:

1. If you're working locally, do a `git pull`
2. Restart npm
3. Wait a while (2 mins)

### CONVERTING TO NEW SITES
